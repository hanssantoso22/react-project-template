# React Project Template
This is a template for React projects, with Babel and Webpack. This doesn't use create-react-app which is usually heavyweight.

2. Install CSS loader (so that the project can parse CSS files): https://blog.jakoblind.no/css-modules-webpack/

2. Disconnect the project with git (delete `.git` directory)
3. Rename the project directory
4. `npm install` to install the necessary packages
5. `npm start` to run the application 
6. Push the repo to remote (https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)
